2013:
 - initial stab at organizing our ad-hoc collection of gridbeam SCAD doodles
 - pulled gridbeam.scad out of MCAD, for rapid development alongside the files using it. all changes to gridbeam.scad will be licensed LGPL v2.1+ to make upstreaming changes to MCAD easy.
 - stubbed model/dxf selection for gridbeam.scad and dome connector
 - modernized and cleaned up syntax
 - works for me, but likely to make an irrational number of your socks disappear, off to github!
