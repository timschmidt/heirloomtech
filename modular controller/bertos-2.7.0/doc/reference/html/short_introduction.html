Installing BeRTOS on your system</h2>
<p>What do you need when developing an embedded project with BeRTOS? </p>
<ul>
<li>a toolchain for your CPU </li>
<li>BeRTOS source code :) </li>
<li>supporting binaries for BeRTOS build system </li>
<li>supporting tools for BeRTOS Wizard</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="http://www.bertos.org/use/tutorial-front-page/installation-instructions/">installation instructions page</a> online for help on installing BeRTOS on your system.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, BeRTOS doesn't need to be 'installed', you can just take .c files and compile them in your project.</p>
<p>However, BeRTOS is a complex system with many dependencies between modules. It's not easy to track the dependencies for each module, so we have developed a set of tools to make dependency tracking automatic.</p>
<p>Contact the <a href="http://forum.bertos.org">support forum</a> and look at the section <a class="el" href="short_introduction.html#coding">Coding guidelines</a> if you want help on using BeRTOS without the supporting tools. Be warned, though, that this method is not supported and we can only point you in the right direction.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="organization"></a>
Project's organization</h2>
<p>Each project has its own full BeRTOS sources, configuration and HAL files. Why? Because we think that each project has its own life and it must not interfere with any other project. Let's say you use a shared BeRTOS version for all of your projects. Each time you update, you need to check that each and every project still works correctly. We don't want to do this (and I bet you don't want either). However, it's still easy to update a single project if you want to.</p>
<p>A project named Foo is organized as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>bertos/ - BeRTOS source directory </li>
<li>Makefile - BeRTOS build system Makefile </li>
<li>project.bertos - Wizard's configuration file </li>
<li>foo/ - your project's main directory </li>
<li>foo/hw/ - low level HAL files </li>
<li>foo/cfg/ - configuration directory </li>
<li>foo/foo_user.mk - makefile fragment that you can edit </li>
<li>foo/foo.mk - makefile fragment changed by the Wizard, don't edit</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="http://www.bertos.org/use/tutorial-front-page/basic-hal/">BeRTOS HAL system</a> for more information on HAL files.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="coding"></a>
Coding guidelines</h2>
<p>BeRTOS assumes that the BeRTOS source directory and the project's root directory (as indicated above) are in the include path. This means that you should include configuration files using "..." rather than &lt;...&gt; style, otherwise you will use default configuration values instead of your project's values.</p>
<p>Also, you should change configuration settings using the Wizard. This is because sometimes there are more actions to be done than simply changing a define value. </p>
